## USER
I want to make a jpeg decoder and encoder and rust, I am not a complete beginner to coding, I have taken my schools first intro class in college and passed with an A, can you give me a roadmap on how I can make a jpeg implentation as someone who does not know anything about compression or hamming codes or anything like that?

## ASSISTANT
Creating a JPEG encoder and decoder in Rust from scratch can be a challenging task, especially if you're not familiar with compression algorithms or Hamming codes. However, with dedication and a structured learning approach, you can work your way up to building your own implementation. Here's a roadmap to help you get started:

1. Learn Rust:
   Before diving into the project, it's crucial to familiarize yourself with the Rust programming language. Some resources to help you get started include:
   - The Rust Programming Language Book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
   - Rust by Example: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/
   - Rustlings: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings

2. Understand JPEG Compression:
   To create a JPEG encoder and decoder, you'll need to grasp the basic concepts of the JPEG compression algorithm. Some important topics include:
   - Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
   - Quantization
   - Huffman coding
   - Chroma subsampling
   - File structure and markers
   You can start by reading these resources:
   - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG
   - http://www.impulseadventure.com/photo/jpeg-decoding.html
   - http://www.impulseadventure.com/photo/jpeg-encoding.html

3. Familiarize yourself with related algorithms and concepts:
   Learn about the following concepts that are useful for understanding the JPEG compression algorithm:
   - Hamming codes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code
   - Run-length encoding (RLE): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding
   - Bit manipulation: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bit-manipulation-beginners/

4. Plan and design your project:
   Break down your project into smaller components (modules) and plan how they will interact. This will help you structure your code and make it more manageable. Some components you may want to include are:
   - DCT and inverse DCT
   - Quantization and dequantization
   - Huffman encoding and decoding
   - File I/O and parsing
   - Chroma subsampling and upsampling

5. Implement your project step-by-step:
   Begin by implementing each module and testing them individually. This will help you catch errors early and ensure that each part of your project is working as expected. As you work through the implementation, refer to the official JPEG standard (ITU-T T.81 | ISO/IEC 10918-1) for guidance: https://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/itu-t81.pdf

6. Optimize and refine your code:
   After completing your initial implementation, optimize your code for performance and improve its readability. Consider using Rust's benchmarking tools to measure and compare the performance of different parts of your code.

7. Document your code:
   Write comprehensive documentation for your project, including comments, README files, and any necessary tutorials or examples. This will make your code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

8. Share your project:
   Share your project with the community by publishing it on platforms like GitHub or GitLab. Encourage feedback and contributions from others to improve your implementation further.

Remember that learning and implementing complex algorithms takes time and practice. Don't get discouraged if you encounter challenges; stay persistent and seek help from the community when needed. Good luck!
